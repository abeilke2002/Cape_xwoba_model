### Cape xwOBA Model

Utilizing the Keras package in python, I set out to create a model that would predict the probabilities of the total base a batted ball recieved using exit velocity and launch angle. I created a deep learning model with hidden layers to better understand the non-linear relationship between EV/LA and batted ball probabilities.

#### Inputs:
- Exit Velocity
- Launch Angle

#### Output:
- Probability of each total base outcome (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
